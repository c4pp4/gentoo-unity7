* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-indicators/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Core python deps. for the Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-lenses/unity-lens-video

* Reasons for patching/maintaining packages:
dev-libs/dee				# Portage tree versions can lag and is now being removed, maintained for patches and version control
dev-libs/libindicator			# See "Using portage tree libindicate packages" above
gnome-extra/activity-log-manager	# Adds unity-control-center integration
gnome-extra/zeitgeist			# Removed from main tree, patched to perform VACUUM SQLite database on startups every 10 days and to pre-populate the log with some events so that the dash isn't empty on first run
media-fonts/fonts-noto-cjk		# Repacked version with reduced size
media-libs/glewmx			# Needed by unity-base/nux, MX discontinued as of GLEW v2.0.0

* Reasons for maintaining ebuild hooks:

app-admin/system-config-printer		# Fix Unity Control Center icon and About dialog icon
app-backup/deja-dup			# Enable Unity7 user interface options

gnome-base/gnome-menus			# Needed for some menu patches but mostly to set XDG_MENU_PREFIX when running in gnome fallback mode
gnome-base/gnome-session		# Installs session files for launching Unity7 user interface
gnome-base/gnome-settings-daemon	# unity-settings-daemon relies on files created from patchset
					# compiz at runtime needs 'terminal' key in 'org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys' schema

gnome-extra/nemo			# Patches nemo-autostart.desktop to allow starting in Unity7 user interface

x11-libs/gtk+				# Needed for global appmenu
x11-misc/lightdm			# Custom fixes for Xsession profile sourcing and multi-monitor display

* Optional ebuild hooks managed via unity-extra/ehooks USE-flags:
app-office/libreoffice			# Add Human icon theme and make it the default
					# Add custom icons (savemodified_{large,small}.png)
					# https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/tree/3498ed37527b7af795f00dc6a55c11e65a313186/icon-themes/human

gnome-extra/nemo			# Remove 'Open as Root' context menu action
media-gfx/eog				# Add traditional menu bar (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/749976, https://bugs.debian.org/793445), add menu translations

media-sound/audacity			# Fix Exec command to use Unity menubar properly
media-video/totem			# Add traditional menubar (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749695)
net-im/pidgin				# Add chat section into messaging menu (Available, Away, Busy, Invisible, Offline)
net-im/telegram-desktop			# Add ubuntu-mono-dark tray icons and disable tray counter

* By design, some indicators or their features will not appear until they meet certain criteria
	- indicator-messages	# Won't appear until a messaging type application is run first (eg. empathy, evolution (via indicator-evolution), pidgin, webapp)
	- indicator-keyboard	# Won't appear until at least one input source is specified and 'Show current input source in menu bar' is checked in System Settings > Text Entry
	- indicator-session	# Won't show username until 'Show my login in menu bar' is checked in System Settings > User Accounts
					and then only if user has been added to /etc/passwd using useradd's '--comment' GECOS field

* Unity user specific settings locations
	- Dconf registry accessible via gsettings or dconf-editor
	- ~/.{cache,config,local}/...
	- /var/lib/AccountsService/users/<user>

* Empathy and message indicator integration
	- To reset all empathy accounts and configurations:
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.config/libaccounts-glib
		rm -rfv ~/.config/Empathy
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/folks
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/folks
	- To debug signond, edit /etc/signond.conf and change 'LoggingLevel=...'
	- To debug signon-ui:
		killall signon-ui
		export SSOUI_LOGGING_LEVEL=2
		signon-ui
	- To debug telepathy packages:
		G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all FOO_PERSIST=1 FOO_DEBUG=all /path/to/telepathy-foo 2>&1 | tee foo.log

* Debugging Unity
	- Emerge unity-base/unity with the 'debug' USE flag enabled, and restart xsession
	- Check ~/.xsession-errors and syslog
	- gsettings get org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins

* Debugging top panel systray/indicator icons and menus
	- In desktop user's xterm, issue the following command:
		killall indicator-application-service; G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all /usr/libexec/indicator-application/indicator-application-service
	- Get list of currently running indicators with the following command:
		dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.canonical.indicator.application \
			/com/canonical/indicator/application/service com.canonical.indicator.application.service.GetApplications

* Ubuntu Single Signon
	- Check ~/.cache/sso/sso-client*.log

## Systemd Session Launch ##
* Unity session is launched as follows:
	- Display manager (eg.lightdm) executes /usr/share/xsessions/unity.desktop:
		- '/usr/share/xsessions/unity.desktop' executes '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target'
			OR
	- Started from console with 'XSESSION=unity startx':
		- '/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99unity-session_systemd' executes '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target'

		- '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target' runs 'systemctl --user start --wait unity-session.target'
		- '/usr/lib/systemd/user/unity-session.target' starts:
			- 'gnome-session.service' which in turn executes 'gnome-session --session=unity'
			- 'unity7.service' is auto-started due to existence of '/usr/lib/systemd/user/unity-session.target.requires/unity7.service' symlink
		- All other Unity systemd service units are then started as being 'PartOf=graphical-session.target'
		- Most importantly, unity7.service unit does the following:
			- Executes '/usr/lib/unity/systemd-prestart-check' to check if we're in an upstart or systemd session
			- Sets the compizconfig profile to 'COMPIZ_CONFIG_PROFILE=ubuntu' via '/usr/lib/unity/compiz-profile-selector'
			- Performs 'ExecStart=/usr/bin/compiz'
			- Pulls in and starts {unity-settings-daemon,unity-panel-service,bamfdaemon}.service units

## Compiz performance settings for 'ccsm' ##
 Click on "OpenGL" and set "Texture Filter" to Fast.
 Make sure "Sync to V blank" is selected, that Texture Compression is NOT selected, and make sure Frame Buffer, Vertex Buffer, and Always Use Buffer Swapping ARE all selected.
 Scroll down to "Image Loading" and make sure all options (jpeg, png, svg, and text) ARE selected.
 * Some applications such as Steam or Chromium with hardware acceleration enabled may lose window focus particularly after unminising the window or waking from screen lock/blank
	- Enabling the 'Keep previews' option under 'Compiz Workarounds' fixes this issue
