# This file contains guidelines on ebuild masking and Ubuntu releases #

* Current Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by ~arch package.keywords
* Development Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by missing keywords
* Any ebuild that installs *.desktop file(s) AND specifies pkg_postinst(), must specify ubuntu-versionator_pkg_postinst
	within pkg_postinst() {...} so that /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index remains up-to-date
* Custom patches for packages that we only wish to patch and not maintain, are placed in profiles/ehooks directory
	see README_ehooks.txt
* When creating or bumping ebuilds that are also maintained within the main portage tree, try to keep it as identical to the portage tree ebuild as possible
