- Updating media-fonts/fonts-ubuntu can cause unreadable menus. Better update the package outside gui.
- Packages depending on gui-libs/libadwaita have Client Side Decoration.
- Unity via unity-base/unity-settings-daemon strips the 'grp' option for XKB keyboard layouts (see LP# 1315867 and overlay issue #133)
	* This can lead to problems trying to use group keyboard layout(s)/variant(s) customised key+combo switching
		Based on bug, requires upstream to patch support into unity-settings-daemon,unity,compiz and unity-control-center

- Lockscreen (Ctrl+Alt+L/Super+L) fails to function when onscreen reader(orca) or keyboard(onboard) are activated (broken since Trusty, see LP# 1310404)
