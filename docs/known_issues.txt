- Upgrading gnome-extra/zeitgeist from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4 can cause dash loading lag.
    * Try resetting the ZeitGeist database with 'rm -rfv ~/.local/share/zeitgeist'.

- Installing the media-fonts/ubuntu-font-family package instead of media-fonts/fonts-ubuntu,
  and vice versa, may cause unreadable menus before session re-login.
    * Preferably install these packages outside of the GUI.

- Packages depending on gui-libs/gtk:4 and gui-libs/libadwaita have Client Side Decoration.

- The tray icon is not shown when using packages based on the Electron framework, such as Joplin or Discord.

    * Use the exec prefix 'env XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity7' as a workaround.

- Some applications using ActionGroup may not display items in the global menu correctly.
  (indicator-appmenu/src/window-menu-model.c: window_menu_model_new is uncomplete)
    * Use the exec prefix 'env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0' as a workaround. This will launch the application with the classic menu.
