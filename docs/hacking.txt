# This file contains guidelines on ebuild creation, masking, and Ubuntu releases #

* Naming convention
- ubuntu package:
	package_name-upstream_version[ubuntu_version][-debian_revision[ubuntu_revision]]
	unity-7.5.1[+21.10.20210601.1][-0[ubuntu1]]
- overlay package:
	package_name-upstream_version-overlay_revision
	unity-7.5.1-r211001.ebuild
- overlay revision:
	-r[release_number][revision_number]
	release number, e.g. 2110
	revision number 01-99
- related ebuild variables declared before the inherit command:
	UVER="+21.10.20210601.1"   # ubuntu version
	UREV="0ubuntu1"		   # ubuntu revision
	inherit ubuntu-versionator

* Development Ubuntu release versions of ebuilds are always masked by ~arch package.keywords
* Any ebuild that installs *.desktop file(s) AND specifies pkg_postinst(), must specify ubuntu-versionator_pkg_postinst
    within pkg_postinst() {...} so that /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index remains up-to-date
* Custom patches for packages that we only wish to patch and not maintain are placed in the profiles/ehooks directory
    see docs/ehooks.md
* When creating or bumping ebuilds that are also maintained within the main portage tree,
    try to keep them as identical to the portage tree ebuilds as possible
* To disable the global menu, you can use the environment variable UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0
